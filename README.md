Here is an app to minimize the efforts required for checking results of yours and your friends. The only app which enables one-tap access to results available on DDIT Egov site. 

You just have to save credentials of users and then you're just one tap away from results. Save yourself from hassle of logging in and going through like million webpages just to check results.

Also get notified whenever a result is updated. No need to keep checking results frequently.

App made exclusively for DDIT students for their convenience.


## Highlights:

• Supports both internal and external results.

• Supports multiple tables for remedial exam results.

• Save multiple users for one-tap results.

• Get notified for internal and external exam results.

• Save result as image or PDF.

• View previously seen result offline.

#### NOTE:
When you try to save result on your phone, please make sure that text is readable on your screen. If it is not, zoom in a little bit and then save. Then only text in image or PDF will be readable.

And keep your eyes and ears wide open, more amazing features will knock your Play Store update anytime soon!
