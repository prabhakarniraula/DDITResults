Here is an app to minimize the efforts required for checking results of yours and your friends. The only app which enables one-tap access to results available on DDIT Egov site. 

You just have to save credentials of users and then you're just one tap away from results. Save yourself from hassle of logging in and going through like million webpages just to check results.

Also get notified whenever a result is updated. No need to keep checking results frequently.

App made exclusively for DDIT students for their convenience.
